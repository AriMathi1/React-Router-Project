#Overview
This project is a simple e-commerce application that uses the Fake Store API to fetch and display a list of products. The application allows users to add items to a cart, manage their cart items, and view the final price with a 10% discount applied. The app implements routing for seamless navigation between the product page and the cart page.

Techstacks used are:
ReactJs
React Router
HTML/CSS and Tailwind CSS for styling
JavaScript for functionality


React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
